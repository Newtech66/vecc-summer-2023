with increasing energy, number of bremsstrahlung emitted decreases
bremsstrahlung loss increases linearly with energy
radiation length is distance over which energy becomes 1/e due to radiation loss only
can we explain the observation with these?
pair production cross section increases with energy
true for bremsstrahlung as well (?)
